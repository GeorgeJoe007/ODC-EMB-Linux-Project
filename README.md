# Project Title
Kernel-User Interface for Kernel Internals Visualization

# Project Goals
1. Develop a Linux kernel module to gather kernel internals data (e.g., CPU usage, memory statistics, task details).
2. Implement a mechanism to pass the collected data to a user-space application.
3. Create a user-space application to receive, process, and display the data in a user-friendly manner.

# Target
QEMU
